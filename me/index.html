<p>Another thing I'm very passionate about is music. I've played guitar for nearly half my life, and I also like to write, record, and produce music.
Lately I've been in an electronic dance phase, of which you can listen to on my <a href="http://www.soundcloud.com/in-clouds/" class="tg">Soundcloud</a>.

  I took the photo in April of 2012, while in the country for the <a href="http://www.ull.ie/" class="tg">&Uacute;ll Conference</a>. It's a beautiful place!
